# AWS Notes

## Why am I making this?

Over the last few years I have been learning a ton of AWS information I want to share it with everyone but it is for myself aswell - Right now I brain dump on people because I am looking for information rather then having links or documents where I canquickly find what I am looking for.

## How will this be set up?

A Service I am writing about will have the following set up.

The EC2 Service Example:
```
Overview/Compute/EC2 -> Content
```
I will be adding knowledge and quick info on to how to do something like the cookbooks you see around AWS or python for example.
