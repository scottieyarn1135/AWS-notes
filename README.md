# AWS Notes

## Why am I making this?

Over the last few years I have been learning a ton of AWS information I want to share it with everyone but it is for myself as-well - Right now I brain dump on people because I am looking for information rather then having links or documents where I can quickly find what I am looking for and while I am looking for the solution I don't need to brain dump ideas.

## How will this be set up?

A Service I am writing about will have the following set up.

The EC2 Service Example:
```
Overview/Compute/EC2 -> Content
```
I will be adding knowledge and quick info on to how to do something like the cookbooks you see around AWS or python for example.

## What content will be on this repo?
<ol>
	<li>Mainly introduction around a service and the uses cases</li>
	 <li>How I have used the service and diagrams of the set up</li>
	 <li>Edge cases - Links or info I don't normally need but it will save time in case I need it</li>
</ol>
